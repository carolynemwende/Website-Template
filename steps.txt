things to note when settin a site using the template

steps
1.npm install
2.gulp dev:install---done in the project root
3.cd src folder 
   .cd src/
   .gem install bundler
   .bundle install

4.npm install -g gulp--this one helps set gulp locally in the project
has a contradiction with gulp dev:install but ill figure out which is which.
